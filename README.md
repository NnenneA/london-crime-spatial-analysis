A critical literature review analyzing the use of Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and ambient population data in understanding London's crime patterns.

# Critical Analysis of Spatial Data Analysis in London Crime Rates

## üìÑ Project Overview
This project is a critical literature review that examines how advanced spatial data analysis (SDA) techniques, like Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and ambient population measures, are used to understand crime patterns in London. It moves beyond traditional crime maps to analyze how socio-economic factors and human mobility create dynamic crime hotspots.

## üéØ Key Questions Explored
- How do GWR and ambient population measures fix the flaws in traditional crime rate analysis?
- What are the combined implications of these methods for understanding and preventing urban crime?
- What are the policy recommendations for law enforcement based on this analysis?

## üîç Key Findings & Conclusions
- **Socio-Economic Factors:** GWR models revealed that crime drivers are hyper-local. For example, higher employment rates in northwest London were linked to *more* crime (likely due to commuter traffic and tourism), while areas with more children showed *less* crime.
- **Ambient Populations:** Traditional methods that only use residential population data underestimate risk in commercial areas. Using daytime population data from mobile phones and censuses provides a much more accurate picture of where crimes actually occur.
- **Policy Impact:** The review recommends that police use a hybrid approach, combining:
  1.  **Real-time mobility data** to deploy patrols dynamically.
  2.  **Socio-economic indicators** to address long-term, root causes of crime in specific neighborhoods.


## üõ† Skills Demonstrated
- **Critical Analysis:** Evaluating and synthesizing findings from multiple academic studies.
- **Spatial Data Concepts:** Understanding of GWR, ambient populations, hotspot analysis, and spatial non-stationarity.
- **Academic Writing:** Producing a well-structured, referenced, and evidence-based literature review.
- **Policy Translation:** Translating complex data analysis into actionable insights for law enforcement and policymakers.
